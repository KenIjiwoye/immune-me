# SMS-04: Enhanced Scheduler Implementation - Summary

## Key Information
- **Task**: Enhanced Scheduler Implementation
- **Dependencies**: SMS-02, SMS-03, BE-06
- **Priority**: High
- **Key Components**: SMSSchedulerService, Cron Jobs, Batch Processing
- **Scheduling**: 7-day, 1-day, overdue reminders with precise timing

## Implementation Overview
This task creates a comprehensive scheduling system that automates SMS reminder processing with the three reminder types (7-day before, 1-day before, 1-day after overdue). The scheduler integrates with AdonisJS cron jobs to provide reliable, scalable, and monitored SMS message processing while respecting API rate limits and handling failures gracefully.

### Core Functionality
1. **Automated Processing**: Cron jobs process pending SMS messages every 5 minutes
2. **Three Reminder Types**: Precise scheduling for 7-day, 1-day, and overdue reminders
3. **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing in configurable batches (50 messages default)
4. **Error Recovery**: Exponential backoff retry logic with dead letter queue
5. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and performance metrics
6. **Manual Operations**: CLI commands for manual processing and diagnostics

### Key Components Created

#### SMSSchedulerService (Core Scheduler)
- **processPendingMessages()**: Main batch processing with rate limiting
- **scheduleDailyReminders()**: Daily notification generation and SMS scheduling
- **processOverdueReminders()**: Dedicated overdue reminder processing
- **getHealthStatus()**: Comprehensive health monitoring and issue detection
- **getStatistics()**: Performance metrics and delivery analytics

#### AdonisJS Cron Jobs
- **Every 5 minutes**: Process pending SMS messages in batches
- **Daily at 6 AM**: Schedule new daily reminders for due immunizations
- **Daily at 2 PM**: Process overdue reminders specifically
- **Every 30 minutes**: Health check monitoring with alerting
- **Daily at midnight**: Generate daily statistics reports

#### CLI Commands
- **sms:process**: Manual SMS processing for troubleshooting
- **sms:health**: Health status check and diagnostics
- **sms:stats**: Statistics and performance reporting

### Scheduling Logic & Timing
- **7-Day Reminder**: Scheduled 7 days before due date at 9:00 AM
- **1-Day Reminder**: Scheduled 1 day before due date at 9:00 AM  
- **Overdue Reminder**: Scheduled 1 day after due date at 2:00 PM
- **Timezone Support**: Configurable timezone handling for accurate timing
- **Batch Delays**: 2-second delays between batches for rate limiting

### Error Handling & Reliability
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 retries with exponential backoff (5, 10, 20 minutes)
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Messages exceeding retry limits moved to dead letter status
- **Failure Classification**: Distinguishes between retryable and permanent failures
- **Processing Locks**: Prevents concurrent processing conflicts
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### Performance & Scalability
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes (default 50 messages)
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delays between batches to respect API limits
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient processing to handle large message volumes
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Cleanup Process**: Automatic cleanup of old processed messages (30-day retention)

### Monitoring & Health Checks
- **Health Status**: Monitors pending counts, failure rates, processing delays
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks sent, delivered, failed, and retry statistics
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for automated alerting
- **Processing Time**: Measures and reports batch processing performance
- **Average Delivery Time**: Calculates delivery performance metrics

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: All timing and processing parameters configurable
- **Batch Sizes**: Configurable processing batch sizes
- **Retry Settings**: Configurable retry attempts and delays
- **Cleanup Settings**: Configurable retention periods and cleanup batches
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable monitoring and alerting thresholds
