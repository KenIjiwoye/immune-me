## Project Overview

The Orange Network SMS API integration extends the existing notification system to support SMS reminders for immunization appointments. The system will send three types of automated reminders:

1. **7-Day Reminder**: Sent 7 days before the scheduled immunization date
2. **1-Day Reminder**: Sent 1 day before the scheduled immunization date  
3. **Overdue Reminder**: Sent 1 day after a missed immunization appointment

## Key Features

### SMS Notification Types
- **Appointment Reminders**: Proactive notifications for upcoming immunizations
- **Overdue Alerts**: Follow-up messages for missed appointments
- **Custom Messages**: Facility-specific messaging with personalization
- **Multi-language Support**: Messages in local languages where supported

### Integration Architecture
- **Service Layer Enhancement**: Extends existing [`NotificationService`](../../backend/app/services/notification_service.ts:1) with SMS capabilities
- **Database Extensions**: New tables for SMS tracking, delivery status, and patient consent
- **Webhook Handling**: Real-time delivery status updates from Orange Network
- **Message Templating**: 160-character optimized templates with dynamic content

### Healthcare Compliance
- **Patient Consent Management**: Opt-in/opt-out functionality for SMS notifications
- **Data Protection**: HIPAA-compliant handling of patient information
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of all SMS communications
- **Privacy Controls**: Secure handling of phone numbers and personal data

## Documentation Approach

This documentation follows the established project-tasks structure with:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each document can be used independently while cross-referencing others
2. **Technical Depth**: Detailed specifications, code examples, and implementation guidance
3. **Practical Focus**: Real-world constraints, limitations, and best practices
4. **Implementation Ready**: Step-by-step guides and configuration templates

## Target Audience

- **Backend Developers**: Implementing the SMS service integration
- **System Administrators**: Managing deployment and configuration
- **Project Managers**: Understanding scope, timeline, and resource requirements
- **Healthcare Staff**: Using SMS features and managing patient communications

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Project Planning
1. Start with [`11-implementation-checklist.md`](11-implementation-checklist.md) for the complete implementation roadmap
2. Review [`07-cost-billing.md`](07-cost-billing.md) for budget planning and cost estimates
3. Check [`06-geographic-constraints.md`](06-geographic-constraints.md) for coverage limitations

### For Technical Implementation
1. Begin with [`01-api-specifications.md`](01-api-specifications.md) for Orange Network API details
2. Follow [`02-integration-requirements.md`](02-integration-requirements.md) for system prerequisites
3. Implement using [`11-implementation-checklist.md`](11-implementation-checklist.md) as your guide
4. Use [`12-quick-reference.md`](12-quick-reference.md) for troubleshooting and common issues

### For Compliance and Operations
1. Review [`05-healthcare-compliance.md`](05-healthcare-compliance.md) for patient data protection
2. Study [`10-operational-constraints.md`](10-operational-constraints.md) for monitoring requirements
3. Implement testing using [`09-development-testing.md`](09-development-testing.md)

## Implementation Timeline

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the SMS integration is planned as a **11-phase development project** requiring **300-340 hours** of development time:

### Phase Overview
- **Phase 0**: OAuth Authentication Foundation - 20-25 hours
- **Phases 1-3**: Foundation (Database, Service Layer, API Integration) - 80-100 hours
- **Phases 4-6**: Core Features (Message Templates, Scheduling, Webhooks) - 80-100 hours
- **Phases 7-9**: Compliance & Security (Consent, Privacy, Audit) - 60-80 hours
- **Phase 10**: Testing & Quality Assurance (Integration, Performance, Production) - 60-80 hours

## Key Technical Decisions

### Orange Network SMS API Selection
- **REST API**: JSON-based communication with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **OAuth 2.0**: Client credentials flow for secure API access
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time delivery status tracking
- **Regional Coverage**: Optimized for Africa and Middle East markets
- **Capacity**: 1M+ messages per day capability

### Architecture Integration
- **OAuth 2.0 Foundation**: Secure token management for all SMS operations
- **AdonisJS Backend**: Extends existing notification system
- **Database Schema**: New tables for SMS tracking and patient consent
- **Service Layer**: Enhanced [`NotificationService`](../../backend/app/services/notification_service.ts:1) with SMS provider abstraction
- **Scheduler Enhancement**: Extended reminder types and timing logic
