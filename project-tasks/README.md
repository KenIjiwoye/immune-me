## Documentation Approach

To address potential token limit issues that might cause truncation of detailed task files, we've implemented a multi-layered documentation approach:

1. **Task Structure Overview**: The `task-structure.md` file provides a high-level overview of all tasks, their dependencies, and key implementation details. This serves as a central reference point.

2. **Detailed Task Files**: Each task has a dedicated markdown file with comprehensive implementation details, including code examples. These files follow a consistent structure:
   - Context
   - Dependencies
   - Requirements
   - Code Examples

3. **Summary Files**: For all frontend tasks, we've created summary files (e.g., `FE-01-summary.md`) that contain the most critical information in a concise format. This ensures that even if detailed task files are truncated due to token limits, the essential details are preserved and accessible.

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Initial Planning

1. Start with `task-structure.md` to understand the overall project structure and task dependencies.
2. Review the summary files for complex tasks to get a quick understanding of key components and functionality.

### For Implementation

1. Begin with the detailed task file for your assigned task.
2. If the file appears to be truncated, refer to the corresponding summary file for essential information.
3. Use the code examples as a starting point for implementation.
4. Check task dependencies to ensure prerequisites are completed.

### For Code Review

1. Use the detailed task files as a reference for expected implementation.
2. Verify that the implementation meets all requirements specified in the task documentation.

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the Task Order**: Implement tasks in the order specified by their dependencies.
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow the coding patterns and conventions demonstrated in the code examples.
3. **Update Documentation**: If you make significant changes to the implementation approach, update the corresponding documentation.
4. **Cross-Reference**: Use the task structure overview to understand how your task fits into the broader project.

## Handling Truncation Issues

If you encounter truncation in a detailed task file:

1. Refer to the corresponding summary file for essential information.
2. Check the task structure overview for context and dependencies.
3. Look at related task files for implementation patterns.
4. If necessary, break down the implementation into smaller, manageable steps.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively navigate and implement the tasks even when facing token limit constraints.
