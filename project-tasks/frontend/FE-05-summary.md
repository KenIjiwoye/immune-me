# FE-05: Reporting and Analytics - Summary

## Key Information
- **Task**: Implement reporting and analytics screens
- **Dependencies**: FE-01, FE-02, BE-07
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Key Screens**: Reports Dashboard, Immunization Coverage, Due Immunizations
- **Key Components**: ReportCard, DateRangePicker, Charts

## Implementation Overview
The reporting and analytics feature provides healthcare workers and administrators with insights into immunization coverage, due immunizations, and other key metrics. This feature helps in tracking progress and making data-driven decisions.

### Core Functionality
1. Viewing immunization coverage by vaccine type
2. Tracking patients due for immunizations
3. Analyzing facility performance (for administrators)
4. Filtering reports by date range and other parameters

### Key Components
- **ReportCard**: A card component for displaying report options
- **DateRangePicker**: A component for selecting date ranges for reports
- **Charts**: Visualization components for displaying data (pie charts, bar charts, etc.)

### Data Flow
1. User selects a report type from the dashboard
2. User applies filters (date range, facility, etc.)
3. System fetches data from the API based on selected filters
4. System displays data in visual and tabular formats
5. User can interact with the visualizations or export the data

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /reports/immunization-coverage` - Get immunization coverage data
- `GET /reports/due-immunizations` - Get list of due immunizations
- `GET /reports/facility-performance` - Get facility performance metrics
- `GET /reports/age-distribution` - Get patient age distribution data

### Implementation Considerations
- Ensure efficient data loading with proper loading indicators
- Implement intuitive filtering mechanisms
- Provide both visual and tabular representations of data
- Consider export functionality for reports (CSV, PDF)
- Optimize chart rendering for mobile devices
- Implement role-based access to certain reports
