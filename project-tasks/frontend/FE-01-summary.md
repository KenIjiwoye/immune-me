# FE-01: Authentication Flow - Summary

## Key Information
- **Task**: Implement authentication flow
- **Dependencies**: BE-03
- **Priority**: High
- **Key Screens**: Login, Protected Routes
- **Key Components**: AuthContext, LoginForm

## Implementation Overview
The authentication flow feature provides secure access to the application, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources. This is a foundational feature that all other features depend on.

### Core Functionality
1. User login with email/username and password
2. Authentication state management
3. Protected routes that require authentication
4. Token storage and refresh
5. Logout functionality

### Key Components
- **AuthContext**: A React Context provider for managing authentication state
- **LoginForm**: A form component for user authentication
- **AuthGuard**: A component that protects routes from unauthorized access
- **SecureStorage**: Utilities for securely storing authentication tokens

### Data Flow
1. User enters credentials on the login screen
2. System validates credentials against the backend
3. On successful authentication, tokens are stored securely
4. Authentication state is updated and maintained across the app
5. Protected routes check authentication state before rendering
6. User can logout, which clears tokens and authentication state

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate user and receive tokens
- `POST /auth/logout` - Invalidate current session
- `POST /auth/refresh-token` - Refresh expired access token
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user information

### Implementation Considerations
- Implement secure token storage using Expo SecureStore
- Handle token expiration and refresh
- Provide clear feedback for authentication errors
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login screen
- Consider biometric authentication for future iterations
