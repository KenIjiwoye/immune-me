# FE-04: Immunization Management - Summary

## Key Information
- **Task**: Implement immunization record management screens
- **Dependencies**: FE-01, FE-02, FE-03, BE-05
- **Priority**: High
- **Key Screens**: Add Immunization, Immunization Details
- **Key Components**: VaccineSelector, PatientInfoCard, DatePicker

## Implementation Overview
The immunization management feature allows healthcare workers to record new immunizations, view immunization details, and manage vaccine schedules. This is a core feature of the application that directly supports the primary use case.

### Core Functionality
1. Recording new immunizations with vaccine selection
2. Viewing immunization details
3. Managing return dates for follow-up doses
4. Validating immunization data entry

### Key Components
- **VaccineSelector**: A modal component for selecting vaccines from a list
- **PatientInfoCard**: A reusable component displaying patient information
- **DatePicker**: Components for selecting administered and return dates

### Data Flow
1. User selects a patient
2. User records a new immunization by selecting a vaccine
3. User enters administration details (date, batch number, etc.)
4. User optionally schedules a return date
5. System saves the immunization record and updates patient history

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /vaccines` - Retrieve available vaccines
- `GET /patients/:id` - Get patient details
- `POST /immunization-records` - Create a new immunization record
- `GET /immunization-records/:id` - Get immunization record details
- `DELETE /immunization-records/:id` - Delete an immunization record

### Implementation Considerations
- Ensure proper validation of required fields
- Implement intuitive date selection
- Provide clear feedback on successful/failed operations
- Consider offline support for remote areas with poor connectivity
