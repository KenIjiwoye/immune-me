# FE-03: Patient Management - Summary

## Key Information
- **Task**: Implement patient management screens
- **Dependencies**: FE-01, FE-02
- **Priority**: High
- **Key Screens**: Patient List, Patient Details, Add/Edit Patient
- **Key Components**: PatientCard, SearchBar, PatientForm

## Implementation Overview
The patient management feature allows healthcare workers to view, add, edit, and search for patients in the system. This is a core feature of the application that serves as the foundation for immunization record management.

### Core Functionality
1. Viewing a list of patients with search and filtering capabilities
2. Viewing detailed patient information
3. Adding new patients to the system
4. Editing existing patient information
5. Viewing patient immunization history

### Key Components
- **PatientCard**: A reusable component for displaying patient information in a list
- **SearchBar**: A component for searching and filtering patients
- **PatientForm**: A form component for adding and editing patient information
- **ImmunizationHistoryList**: A component for displaying a patient's immunization history

### Data Flow
1. User navigates to the patient list screen
2. User can search for patients by name or other criteria
3. User selects a patient to view details
4. User can add a new patient or edit an existing patient
5. User can view a patient's immunization history and add new immunizations

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /patients` - Retrieve a list of patients with pagination and filtering
- `GET /patients/:id` - Get detailed patient information
- `POST /patients` - Create a new patient
- `PUT /patients/:id` - Update an existing patient
- `GET /patients/:id/immunization-records` - Get a patient's immunization history

### Implementation Considerations
- Implement efficient search and filtering for large patient databases
- Ensure proper validation of patient data
- Provide clear feedback on successful/failed operations
- Consider offline support for remote areas with poor connectivity
- Implement pagination for the patient list to handle large datasets
