# Appwrite Backend Implementation

This directory contains the Appwrite backend implementation for the Immune Me application, providing a cloud-native alternative to the current AdonisJS backend.

## Overview

The Appwrite backend leverages Appwrite's Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform to provide:

- **Database Management**: NoSQL document-based collections for patient data, immunization records, and system entities
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Built-in user management with role-based access control
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data synchronization
- **File Storage**: Secure file uploads and management for patient documents and reports
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless functions for business logic, notifications, and data processing
- **API Gateway**: RESTful APIs with automatic documentation and SDK generation

## Architecture

The Appwrite implementation follows a microservices architecture with:

- **Collections**: Database schemas for core entities (patients, immunizations, facilities, etc.)
- **Functions**: Serverless functions for complex business logic and integrations
- **Security Rules**: Fine-grained permissions and access control
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates for critical data changes

## Directory Structure

- `functions/` - Appwrite Cloud Functions for business logic
- `schemas/` - Database collection schemas and validation rules
- `config/` - Appwrite project configuration and environment setup
- `utils/` - Shared utilities and helper functions
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions for Appwrite entities
- `migrations/` - Data migration scripts and procedures

## Migration Strategy

This backend implementation is designed to:

1. **Parallel Development**: Run alongside the existing AdonisJS backend during transition
2. **Data Migration**: Provide tools to migrate existing data from PostgreSQL to Appwrite
3. **API Compatibility**: Maintain similar API contracts for seamless frontend integration
4. **Feature Parity**: Implement all existing backend functionality with enhanced capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Set up an Appwrite project and configure the environment
2. Deploy the database schemas and collections
3. Deploy the cloud functions
4. Configure authentication and security rules
5. Run data migration scripts (if migrating from existing system)

## Benefits

- **Reduced Infrastructure Complexity**: Managed backend services
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling cloud functions and database
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Built-in WebSocket support
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- **Developer Experience**: Rich SDKs and development tools
