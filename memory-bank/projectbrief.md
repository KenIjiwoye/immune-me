# Project Brief: Immunization Records Management System

## Project Overview

The Immunization Records Management System is a comprehensive digital solution designed to modernize immunization record keeping in healthcare facilities, with specific focus on supporting the Liberia Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule.

## Core Problem Statement

Healthcare facilities in Liberia and similar contexts face significant challenges with manual, paper-based immunization record keeping:

1. **Data Loss and Inefficiency**: Paper records are prone to loss, damage, and difficult to access quickly
2. **Compliance Tracking**: Manual systems make it challenging to track which patients are due for immunizations
3. **Reporting Difficulties**: Generating insights and compliance reports from paper records is time-consuming and error-prone
4. **Schedule Management**: Managing complex immunization schedules with multiple vaccine series is difficult manually

## Solution Approach

A mobile-first, containerized application that provides:

1. **Digital Record Management**: Complete digitization of immunization records with secure storage
2. **Schedule Compliance**: Automated tracking of the Liberia EPI schedule with due date notifications
3. **Role-Based Access**: Different interfaces and permissions for Nurses, Doctors, Administrators, and Supervisors
4. **Real-Time Analytics**: Instant reporting and compliance monitoring at individual and facility levels

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: AdonisJS v6 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Liberia-specific schema enhancements
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive validation

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform mobile support
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, Context API for authentication
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with drawer navigation

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose orchestration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with persistent volumes
- **Environment**: Environment-based configuration for development/production

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality ✅
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login with role-based access
2. **Patient Management**: Complete CRUD operations for patient records
3. **Vaccine Management**: Comprehensive vaccine database with Liberia EPI support
4. **Immunization Recording**: Digital recording of vaccine administration
5. **Notification System**: Automated alerts for due immunizations
6. **Settings & Profile**: User profile management and application settings

### Liberia EPI Schedule Support ✅
- **Vaccine Series Tracking**: Support for multi-dose vaccines (OPV, Penta, PCV, etc.)
- **Schedule Compliance**: Monitoring of on-schedule, delayed, and missed vaccinations
- **Health Worker Attribution**: Recording of administering health worker
- **Standard Schedule Ages**: Age-based vaccination recommendations

## Data Model

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Healthcare staff with roles (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Supervisor)
- **Facilities**: Healthcare facilities where immunizations occur
- **Patients**: Individuals receiving immunizations
- **Vaccines**: Available vaccines with series and schedule information
- **Immunization Records**: Records of administered vaccines
- **Notifications**: Alerts for due immunizations

### Liberia-Specific Enhancements
- **Vaccine Codes**: Standard codes for Liberia EPI vaccines
- **Sequence Numbers**: Tracking of vaccine series (e.g., OPV1, OPV2, OPV3)
- **Schedule Status**: Compliance tracking (on schedule, delayed, missed)
- **Supplementary Activities**: Support for campaign immunizations

## Current Status

### Completed Components
1. **Backend Infrastructure**: Complete API with all CRUD operations
2. **Frontend Foundation**: Authentication, navigation, and core components
3. **Settings Management**: User profiles and application settings
4. **Notification System**: Due date alerts and notification management
5. **Patient Management**: Patient registration and record management
6. **Vaccine System**: Comprehensive vaccine model with selection interface

### Next Priority: Admin Vaccine Management
The system currently has a robust vaccine infrastructure but lacks an administrative interface for managing vaccine items. This is the immediate next priority to enable administrators to:
- Add new vaccines to the system
- Update existing vaccine information
- Manage vaccine series and schedules
- Configure Liberia EPI schedule items

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of healthcare staff actively using the system
2. **Compliance Improvement**: Increase in on-schedule immunization rates
3. **Time Efficiency**: Reduction in time spent on record keeping and reporting
4. **Data Accuracy**: Reduction in record-keeping errors
5. **Reporting Speed**: Faster generation of compliance and coverage reports

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Admin Management (Current Priority)
- Admin vaccine management interface
- Schedule configuration tools
- Bulk vaccine import/export

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics
- Advanced compliance dashboards
- Facility-level performance metrics
- Predictive analytics for vaccine needs

### Phase 3: Integration & Expansion
- Integration with national health information systems
- Multi-facility coordination
- Mobile offline capabilities
- Multilingual support

## Technical Standards

### Development Standards
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all data validation
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for critical paths
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API and component documentation

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure storage
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted sensitive data storage
- **Audit Trails**: Logging of all data modifications

### Performance Standards
- **Response Time**: API responses under 200ms for standard operations
- **Mobile Performance**: Smooth 60fps UI interactions
- **Offline Capability**: Basic functionality without network (future)
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple facilities and thousands of patients

This project represents a significant step toward modernizing healthcare record keeping in Liberia and similar contexts, with the potential for substantial impact on immunization compliance and public health outcomes.
