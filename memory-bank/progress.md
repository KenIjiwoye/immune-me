# Project Progress

## Current Status

The Immunization Records Management System is in the **initial setup phase**. The project has been scaffolded with basic frontend and backend structures, but no functional features have been implemented yet.

### Project Timeline

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Requirements Gathering | ‚úÖ Complete | Project brief with detailed requirements created |
| Project Setup | üîÑ In Progress | Basic scaffolding of frontend and backend |
| Backend Development | ‚è≥ Not Started | API endpoints, authentication, database |
| Frontend Development | ‚è≥ Not Started | UI components, screens, data fetching |
| Integration | ‚è≥ Not Started | Connecting frontend to backend |
| Testing | ‚è≥ Not Started | Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing |
| Deployment | ‚è≥ Not Started | Setting up production environment |

## What Works

As the project is in the initial setup phase, only the basic project structure is in place:

1. **Project Documentation**:
   - Detailed project brief with requirements
   - Memory bank documentation for project context

2. **Backend**:
   - AdonisJS v6 project initialized
   - Basic project structure following AdonisJS conventions
   - Initial database migration for users table

3. **Frontend**:
   - React Native (Expo) project initialized
   - Basic project structure with file-based routing

## What's Left to Build

### Backend Development

1. **Database Setup**:
   - [ ] Configure PostgreSQL connection
   - [ ] Create migrations for all required tables:
     - [ ] Patients
     - [ ] Facilities
     - [ ] Vaccines
     - [ ] Immunization Records
     - [ ] Notifications

2. **Authentication System**:
   - [ ] Implement JWT authentication
   - [ ] Create login endpoint
   - [ ] Implement refresh token mechanism
   - [ ] Configure role-based access control

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - [ ] Users CRUD
   - [ ] Patients CRUD
   - [ ] Facilities CRUD
   - [ ] Vaccines CRUD
   - [ ] Immunization Records CRUD
   - [ ] Notifications CRUD
   - [ ] Reports and Analytics endpoints

4. **Business Logic**:
   - [ ] Notification generation service
   - [ ] Reporting and analytics service
   - [ ] Data validation and sanitization

### Frontend Development

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - [ ] Login screen
   - [ ] Password recovery
   - [ ] Token management
   - [ ] Protected routes

2. **Navigation Structure**:
   - [ ] Authentication stack
   - [ ] Main application stack
   - [ ] Tab navigation for main sections

3. **Core Screens**:
   - [ ] Dashboard
   - [ ] Patient list with search and filtering
   - [ ] Patient details
   - [ ] Immunization form
   - [ ] Notifications screen
   - [ ] Reports and analytics

4. **Data Management**:
   - [ ] API service setup
   - [ ] TanStack Query implementation
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Loading states

5. **UI Components**:
   - [ ] Form components
   - [ ] List components
   - [ ] Card components
   - [ ] Modal components
   - [ ] Chart components for analytics

### Integration and Testing

1. **Integration**:
   - [ ] Connect frontend to backend API
   - [ ] Handle authentication flow
   - [ ] Implement data fetching and mutations

2. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Backend unit tests
   - [ ] API integration tests
   - [ ] Frontend component tests
   - [ ] End-to-end tests

### Deployment

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - [ ] Set up Render.com deployment
   - [ ] Configure environment variables
   - [ ] Set up database in production

2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - [ ] Build for Android and iOS
   - [ ] Configure app distribution

## Known Issues

As the project is in the initial setup phase, there are no specific issues to report yet. Potential challenges to address:

1. **Authentication**: Ensuring secure, role-based access control
2. **Data Modeling**: Optimizing database schema for performance
3. **Mobile Performance**: Ensuring responsive UI on various devices
4. **Offline Capability**: Determining approach for potential offline functionality

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As the project progresses, key decisions and their evolution will be documented here. Initial decisions include:

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - Decision: React Native (Expo) for frontend, AdonisJS v6 for backend
   - Rationale: Cross-platform mobile development, TypeScript support, developer productivity

2. **Database**:
   - Decision: PostgreSQL
   - Rationale: Relational database for structured healthcare data, strong consistency guarantees

3. **Authentication**:
   - Decision: JWT-based authentication
   - Rationale: Stateless authentication for API, support for role-based access control
