   - Memory bank documentation for project context
   - Comprehensive task documentation with:
     - High-level task structure overview
     - Detailed task files with code examples
     - Summary files for complex tasks to address potential truncation issues
     - README explaining the documentation approach

3. **Backend**:
   - AdonisJS v6 project initialized
   - Basic project structure following AdonisJS conventions
   - Initial database migration for users table
   - PostgreSQL database connection configured and tested
   - Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment

4. **Frontend**:
   - React Native (Expo) project initialized
   - Basic project structure with file-based routing
   - Essential development packages installed:
     - Zod for schema validation
     - TanStack Query for server state management
     - React Hook Form for form handling
     - React Native Toast Message for user feedback
   - Containerized with Docker for web deployment

## What's Left to Build

### Backend Development

1. **Database Setup**:
   - [x] Configure PostgreSQL connection
   - [ ] Create migrations for all required tables:
     - [ ] Patients

   - [ ] Patients CRUD
   - [ ] Facilities CRUD
   - [ ] Vaccines CRUD
   - [ ] Immunization Records CRUD
   - [ ] Notifications CRUD
   - [ ] Reports and Analytics endpoints

4. **Business Logic**:
   - [ ] Notification generation service

   - [ ] Data validation and sanitization

### Frontend Development

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - [ ] Login screen
   - [ ] Password recovery
   - [ ] Token management
   - [ ] Protected routes

2. **Navigation Structure**:
   - [ ] Authentication stack
   - [ ] Main application stack
   - [ ] Tab navigation for main sections

3. **Core Screens**:
   - [ ] Dashboard
   - [ ] Patient list with search and filtering
   - [ ] Patient details
   - [ ] Immunization form
   - [ ] Notifications screen
   - [ ] Reports and analytics

4. **Data Management**:
   - [ ] API service setup
   - [ ] TanStack Query implementation
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Loading states

5. **UI Components**:
   - [ ] Form components
   - [ ] List components
   - [ ] Card components
   - [ ] Modal components
   - [ ] Chart components for analytics

### Integration and Testing

1. **Integration**:
   - [ ] Connect frontend to backend API
   - [ ] Handle authentication flow
   - [ ] Implement data fetching and mutations

2. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Backend unit tests
   - [ ] API integration tests
   - [ ] Frontend component tests
   - [ ] End-to-end tests

### Deployment

1. **Containerization**:
   - [x] Create Dockerfile for backend
   - [x] Create Dockerfile for frontend
   - [x] Set up docker-compose.yml for orchestration
   - [x] Configure environment variables
   - [x] Set up Docker network
   - [x] Configure volume for database persistence
   - [x] Implement health checks
   - [x] Document Docker setup in README

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - [ ] Set up Render.com deployment
   - [ ] Configure environment variables
   - [ ] Set up database in production

3. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - [ ] Build for Android and iOS
   - [ ] Configure app distribution

## Known Issues

As the project is in the initial setup phase, there are a few issues to address:

1. **Documentation Truncation**: Some task files may be truncated due to token limits when loaded by AI assistants. This has been addressed by:
   - Creating a task structure overview file
   - Developing summary files for complex tasks
   - Organizing documentation to prioritize critical information at the beginning of files

2. **Potential Challenges**:
   - **Authentication**: Ensuring secure, role-based access control
   - **Data Modeling**: Optimizing database schema for performance
   - **Mobile Performance**: Ensuring responsive UI on various devices
   - **Offline Capability**: Determining approach for potential offline functionality

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As the project progresses, key decisions and their evolution will be documented here. Current decisions include:

1. **Containerization Strategy**:
   - Decision: Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
   - Rationale: Consistent environments, simplified deployment, isolated services
   - Implementation: Multi-stage builds, service orchestration, volume management

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Decision: React Native (Expo) for frontend, AdonisJS v6 for backend
   - Rationale: Cross-platform mobile development, TypeScript support, developer productivity
   - Implementation: Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment

3. **Database**:
   - Decision: PostgreSQL
   - Rationale: Relational database for structured healthcare data, strong consistency guarantees
   - Implementation: Connection configured in AdonisJS with environment variables and proper defaults
   - Containerization: Official PostgreSQL Alpine image with persistent volume

4. **Authentication**:
   - Decision: JWT-based authentication
   - Rationale: Stateless authentication for API, support for role-based access control

5. **Documentation Structure**:
   - Decision: Multi-layered approach with overview, detailed files, and summaries
   - Rationale: Address potential token limit issues while providing comprehensive guidance
   - Implementation: Created task-structure.md, detailed task files, and summary files for complex tasks
