# BE-AW-07 Completion Summary

Implemented RBAC and permissions for Appwrite backend.

Deliverables:
- Role definitions: appwrite-backend/config/role-definitions.json
- Collection permissions: appwrite-backend/config/collection-permissions.json
- Helpers: appwrite-backend/utils/permission-helpers.js
- Teams setup: appwrite-backend/config/teams-setup.js
- Audit schemas: appwrite-backend/schemas/audit-collections.json
- Functions:
  - validate-document-access (RBAC + facility isolation + audit write)
  - assign-user-role (role hierarchy enforcement + role change audit)
  - audit-access-log (centralized logging helper)
- Security utilities/docs:
  - appwrite-backend/utils/setup-security-rules.js
  - appwrite-backend/SECURITY_RULES.md
  - appwrite-backend/COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md
- Tests:
  - appwrite-backend/tests/permissions/role-definitions.test.js

Notes:
- Set APPWRITE_ENDPOINT, APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID, APPWRITE_API_KEY, and optionally APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID (default: immune-me-db).
- Teams IDs: admin-team, facility-managers, healthcare-workers, data-entry-clerks.

- Collection-level permissions set (collection-permissions.json; setup-security-rules.js)
- Document-level security rules (validate-document-access)
- Permission validation functions (validate-document-access)
- Facility data isolation (validate-document-access)
- Audit logging for permission changes (assign-user-role; audit-access-log; schemas)
- Role assignment management (assign-user-role)
- Permission testing suite (tests/permissions)
- Security rules docs (SECURITY_RULES.md)
- Compliance validation (COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md)
