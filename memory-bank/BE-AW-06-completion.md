# BE-AW-06: Offline-First Data Synchronization Functions - COMPLETED

## Task Summary
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Date: 2025-08-25
Duration: ~6-8 hours (within overall epic timeline)

## What Was Implemented

### Core Functions
1) Incremental Data Sync
- Path: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/incremental-data-sync/src/main.js
- Features:
  - Incremental sync by $updatedAt with pagination (limit/cursor/maxPages)
  - Facility-scoped filtering based on user permissions
  - Deleted document propagation via deletion_log
  - Sync operation logging to sync_operations
  - Optional gzip+base64 response compression for optimization
  - Configurable defaults via config/sync-configuration.json

2) Conflict Resolution
- Path: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/conflict-resolution/src/main.js
- Features:
  - Strategies per collection (server_wins, client_wins, merge_with_server_priority, merge_with_client_priority, field_level_merge)
  - Audit trail written to conflict_log
  - Schema-aligned field naming (snake_case for logs)
  - Safe create/update behavior based on timestamp precedence

3) Offline Queue Processor
- Path: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/offline-queue-processor/src/main.js
- Features:
  - Ordered processing of queued operations (create/update/delete)
  - Delegation of updates to conflict-resolution function
  - Soft delete pattern with deletion_log
  - Retryability classification for failure recovery
  - Processing summary written to queue_processing_log

4) Real-time Sync Trigger
- Path: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/real-time-sync-trigger/src/main.js
- Features:
  - Database event-driven notifications to active sessions
  - Creation of sync_notifications and realtime_notifications records
  - Heartbeat window control for session staleness
  - Function event configuration at appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/real-time-sync-trigger/function.json

5) Data Validation
- Path: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/data-validation/src/main.js
- Features:
  - Schema-based validation (required + type checks) using config rules
  - Mode "validate" or "upsert" (optional update/create behavior)
  - Aligns with validation configuration in sync-configuration.json

6) Sync Status Monitor
- Path: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/sync-status-monitor/src/main.js
- Features:
  - Aggregates metrics from sync_operations, queue_processing_log, conflict_log, active_sync_sessions, sync_notifications, realtime_notifications, deletion_log
  - Computes overall health (healthy/warning/degraded)
  - Supports filtering by device_id/user_id/facility_id and time window

### Shared Utilities and Configuration
- Utilities: appwrite-backend/utils/sync-utilities.js
  - Helpers: time, JSON parsing, sanitization, retry classification, batching, gzip compression, query builders
  - Facility filter, updated-since filter, pagination helpers

- Configuration: appwrite-backend/config/sync-configuration.json
  - Defaults for collections, batching, heartbeat window
  - Conflict strategy map per collection
  - Validation rules for patients, immunization_records, notifications
  - Logging collection names
  - Function IDs mapping

### Sync-Related Collections (Schemas)
- Path: appwrite-backend/schemas/sync-collections.json
- Collections created:
  - sync_operations
  - deletion_log
  - queue_processing_log
  - conflict_log
  - active_sync_sessions
  - sync_notifications
  - realtime_notifications
- All collections use snake_case attributes to ensure uniformity and performance-oriented indexes.

### Package Manifests (per-function)
- incremental-data-sync: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/incremental-data-sync/package.json
- conflict-resolution: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/conflict-resolution/package.json
- offline-queue-processor: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/offline-queue-processor/package.json
- real-time-sync-trigger: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/real-time-sync-trigger/package.json
- data-validation: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/data-validation/package.json
- sync-status-monitor: appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/sync-status-monitor/package.json

## Acceptance Criteria Status
- Incremental data sync functions created and deployed-ready: ✅
- Conflict resolution algorithms implemented: ✅
- Data validation and integrity checking functions operational: ✅
- Real-time sync triggers configured (function.json + code): ✅
- Offline queue processing functions working: ✅
- Sync status tracking and monitoring implemented: ✅
- Data compression and optimization functions deployed (gzip+base64 option): ✅
- Batch sync operations for large datasets functional (pagination + limits): ✅
- Sync failure recovery mechanisms implemented (retryable classification, logs): ✅
- Client sync API endpoints created (functions callable via Appwrite Functions): ✅

## Testing Guidance
- Function execution (Node):
  - Use node-appwrite Functions.createExecution with payloads similar to the examples in the ticket BE-AW-06.
- Incremental Sync:
  - Payload fields: deviceId, userId, lastSyncTimestamp, collections, pageLimit, pageCursor, compress
- Conflict Resolution:
  - Payload fields: collection, documentId, clientData, clientTimestamp, deviceId, userId
- Offline Queue:
  - Payload fields: deviceId, userId, queuedOperations (array of {type, collection, documentId, data, timestamp})
- Real-time Trigger:
  - Verify function.json events and use Appwrite Console to simulate document changes
- Validation:
  - Payload fields: collection, documents: [ { $id?, ...fields } ], mode: "validate" | "upsert"
- Status Monitor:
  - Payload fields: sinceMinutes, deviceId?, userId?, facilityId?

## Notable Implementation Details
- Field Naming Strategy:
  - User data collections (patients/immunization_records/etc.) retain their schema naming.
  - Sync log collections (e.g., sync_operations, conflict_log) use snake_case attribute naming for consistency and clarity. All code paths writing to these collections have been normalized.
- Permissions:
  - Functions use role:authenticated or role:system as appropriate (real-time trigger runs as system).
- Performance:
  - Configurable batch sizes and page limits in sync-configuration.json
  - Compression optional return path for incremental sync

## Next Steps
- Wire up frontend sync client to these functions (FE-AW-02, FE-AW-05).
- Add dashboards and alerts for sync-status-monitor output.
- Expand validation rules as needed per evolving domain requirements.
- Integrate automatic retries for retryable failures with exponential backoff if required.

## Files Created/Modified (Key)
- appwrite-backend/utils/sync-utilities.js
- appwrite-backend/config/sync-configuration.json
- appwrite-backend/schemas/sync-collections.json
- appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/incremental-data-sync/src/main.js
- appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/conflict-resolution/src/main.js

- appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/real-time-sync-trigger/src/main.js
- appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/data-validation/src/main.js
- appwrite-backend/functions/data-sync/sync-status-monitor/src/main.js
- function.json for incremental-data-sync and real-time-sync-trigger
- package.json for all six functions

## Rollback Notes
- New collections are additive; disabling functions reverts system to previous behavior.
- Deletion_log preserves original documents for potential restoration.
- No destructive migrations performed as part of this task.
