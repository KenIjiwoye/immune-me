## Key Features Implemented

### Four-Tier Role System
1. **Administrator** - Full system access across all facilities
2. **Supervisor** - Facility-level administrative access with user management
3. **Doctor** - Healthcare professional access for patient care
4. **User** - Basic read-only access to assigned facility data

### Label-Based Role Assignment
- Uses Appwrite's user labels for role storage (`administrator`, `supervisor`, `doctor`, `user`)
- Facility assignment via labels (`facility_1`, `facility_2`, etc.)
- Automatic role validation and hierarchy enforcement
- Default role assignment for new users

### Facility-Based Access Control
- Strict facility isolation for non-administrator roles
- Cross-facility access prevention with security validation
- Facility-specific data filtering at document level
- Multi-facility access for administrators only

### Security Features
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention** - Role hierarchy enforcement prevents lower-level users from assigning higher roles
- **Cross-Facility Security** - Non-administrators cannot access or modify data from other facilities
- **Permission Validation** - Granular permission checking for all operations (create, read, update, delete)
- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive access attempt logging with IP tracking and user agent capture
- **Input Validation** - Strict validation of role assignments and facility IDs

## Architecture Overview

### Role Storage Mechanism
The system uses Appwrite's user labels to store role and facility information:
```javascript
// Example user labels
user.labels = ['doctor', 'facility_1', 'custom_label']
```

### Role Hierarchy
```
Administrator (Level 4) - Full system access
    ↓
Supervisor (Level 3) - Facility admin access
    ↓
Doctor (Level 2) - Patient care access
    ↓
User (Level 1) - Read-only access
```

### Permission Structure
Each role has defined permissions for different resources:
- **patients**: create, read, update, delete
- **immunization_records**: create, read, update, delete
- **facilities**: create, read, update, delete
- **vaccines**: create, read, update, delete
- **notifications**: create, read, update, delete
- **users**: create, read, update, delete
- **reports**: create, read, update, delete
- **system_settings**: read, update

### Data Access Levels
- **all_facilities**: Administrator access to all facility data
- **facility_only**: Restricted access to assigned facility data only

## Usage Instructions

### Initialize Role Manager
```javascript
const RoleManager = require('./utils/role-manager');

const roleManager = new RoleManager({
  endpoint: process.env.APPWRITE_ENDPOINT,
  projectId: process.env.APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID,
  apiKey: process.env.APPWRITE_API_KEY,
  cacheTimeout: 300000 // 5 minutes
});
```

### Assign Role to User
```javascript
const result = await roleManager.assignRole(
  'user123',           // User ID
  'doctor',           // Role
  '1'                 // Facility ID (required for non-admin roles)
);
```

### Check User Permissions
```javascript
const hasPermission = await roleManager.hasPermission(
  'user123',          // User ID or user object
  'patients',         // Resource
  'create'           // Operation
);
```

### Validate Facility Access
```javascript
const canAccess = await roleManager.validateFacilityAccess(
  'user123',          // User ID or user object
  '1'                 // Facility ID to check
);
```

### Get Complete User Role Information
```javascript
const roleInfo = await roleManager.getUserRoleInfo('user123');
// Returns: role, facilityId, permissions, specialPermissions, etc.
```

## Security Features

### 1. Privilege Escalation Prevention
- Role hierarchy enforcement prevents users from assigning roles higher than their own
- Administrators can assign any role
- Supervisors can assign doctor and user roles only
- Doctors and users cannot assign roles

### 2. Facility-Based Security
- Non-administrators are restricted to their assigned facility
- Cross-facility data access is blocked at the document level
- Facility ID validation for all operations
- Automatic facility filtering in database queries

### 3. Permission Granularity
- Resource-level permissions (patients, reports, etc.)
- Operation-level permissions (create, read, update, delete)
- Special permissions for advanced features
- Role-based data access levels

### 4. Audit and Compliance
- Comprehensive access logging with timestamps
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Role change history tracking
- Failed access attempt logging

### 5. Input Validation
- Role existence validation
- Facility ID requirement enforcement
- User existence verification
- Malformed data handling

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching System
- In-memory user data caching with configurable timeout (default: 5 minutes)
- Cache invalidation on role changes
- Concurrent request optimization
- Performance monitoring for cache hit rates

### Efficient Data Retrieval
- Single API calls for user information
- Batch operations support for multiple role assignments
- Optimized permission checking algorithms
- Minimal database queries through caching

### Scalability Features
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Configurable cache timeouts
- Efficient role hierarchy calculations
- Optimized label-based storage

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Role Templates** - Pre-defined role configurations for common use cases
2. **Time-Based Permissions** - Temporary role assignments with expiration
3. **Advanced Audit Features** - Detailed permission usage analytics
4. **Role Inheritance** - Complex role hierarchies with inheritance
5. **External Identity Provider Integration** - SSO and LDAP integration
6. **Permission Delegation** - Temporary permission sharing between users

### Scalability Improvements
1. **Distributed Caching** - Redis integration for multi-instance deployments
2. **Database Optimization** - Indexed queries for large user bases
3. **Async Processing** - Background role assignment processing
4. **Rate Limiting** - API rate limiting for role management operations

### Security Enhancements
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - MFA requirement for role changes
2. **IP Whitelisting** - Location-based access restrictions
3. **Session Management** - Advanced session security features
4. **Encryption** - Enhanced data encryption for sensitive operations
