# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The Immunization Records Management System is in the initial setup phase. The project has been scaffolded with:

1. **Backend**: AdonisJS v6 application with basic configuration
   - Basic project structure established
   - Database migrations for users table created
   - Authentication module installed but not configured
   - Routes file contains only a "hello world" endpoint

2. **Frontend**: React Native application using Expo
   - Basic project structure established
   - Default screen with placeholder content
   - No custom components or screens implemented yet

3. **Task Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation structure created
   - High-level task structure overview
   - Detailed task files with code examples
   - Summary files for complex tasks to address potential truncation issues
   - README explaining the documentation approach

## Recent Changes

Recent changes to the project include:

1. **Database Configuration**: Completed the PostgreSQL database configuration for the AdonisJS v6 backend:
   - Updated `backend/config/database.ts` with proper environment variable usage and defaults
   - Changed connection key from 'postgres' to 'pg'
   - Fixed type issues with port by using `Number(env.get('DB_PORT', 5432))`
   - Added seeders configuration with paths to 'database/seeders'
   - Removed unsupported 'healthCheck' property
   - Updated environment variables in `.env` file
   - Successfully tested the database connection

2. **Task Documentation Structure**: Created a multi-layered documentation approach to address potential token limit issues:
   - Created `task-structure.md` with a high-level overview of all tasks
   - Developed detailed task files with comprehensive implementation details
   - Added summary files for complex frontend tasks that might be truncated
   - Created a README explaining how to use the documentation effectively

3. **Project Organization**:
   - Organized tasks into backend, frontend, integration, and deployment categories
   - Established clear dependencies between tasks
   - Prioritized tasks to guide implementation order

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

### Documentation Refinement

1. **Review Task Documentation**:
   - Ensure all task files follow the established structure
   - Verify that summary files contain all critical information
   - Check cross-references between related tasks

### Backend Development

1. **Database Setup** (BE-01, BE-02):
   - âœ… Configure PostgreSQL connection (BE-01 completed)
   - Create migrations for all required tables (Patients, Facilities, Vaccines, Immunization Records, Notifications) (BE-02)

2. **Authentication System** (BE-03):
   - Implement JWT authentication
   - Configure role-based access control

3. **API Endpoints** (BE-05):
   - Implement CRUD operations for all entities
   - Add validation for request data
   - Implement error handling

### Frontend Development

1. **Authentication Flow** (FE-01):
   - Set up authentication context
   - Create login screen
   - Implement password recovery

2. **Dashboard Screen** (FE-02):
   - Create main navigation structure
   - Implement summary statistics
   - Add quick action buttons

3. **Patient Management** (FE-03):
   - Implement patient list with search
   - Create patient details screen
   - Add patient creation/editing functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - Multi-layered approach to address token limit issues
   - Prioritizing critical information at the beginning of files
   - Using summary files for complex tasks
   - Providing clear cross-references between related tasks

2. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Using JWT for stateless authentication
   - Need to determine token expiration policy
   - Consider refresh token implementation

3. **Data Modeling**:
   - Relationships between entities defined in project brief
   - PostgreSQL database configured with proper connection settings
   - Need to finalize database schema details through migrations
   - Consider indexing strategy for performance

4. **API Design**:
   - RESTful API structure defined
   - Need to standardize response formats
   - Consider pagination for list endpoints

5. **UI/UX Approach**:
   - Mobile-first design for hospital staff
   - Need to establish component library
   - Consider offline capabilities for future iterations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Documentation Patterns**:
   - Task files follow a consistent structure: Context, Dependencies, Requirements, Code Examples
   - Summary files focus on key information: Core Functionality, Key Components, Data Flow, API Endpoints
   - Cross-references between related tasks to provide context

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Backend follows AdonisJS conventions with controllers, models, and services
   - Frontend uses feature-based organization
   - Components are designed to be reusable across screens

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for React components
   - camelCase for variables and functions
   - snake_case for database columns
   - Task files follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., BE-01-database-config.md)

4. **State Management**:
   - TanStack Query for server state
   - Context API for global application state

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - Backend: Unit tests for services, integration tests for API endpoints
   - Frontend: Component tests and end-to-end tests

## Learnings and Project Insights

As the project progresses, key insights are being documented:

1. **Documentation Challenges**:
   - Token limits can cause truncation of detailed task files
   - A multi-layered documentation approach helps address this issue
   - Prioritizing critical information at the beginning of files ensures it's not lost
   - Summary files provide essential context even when detailed files are truncated

2. **Healthcare Data Sensitivity**:
   - All patient data must be handled with appropriate security measures
   - Compliance with healthcare data regulations is essential

3. **User Experience for Healthcare Workers**:
   - Interface must be efficient for busy healthcare environments
   - Quick access to patient records is a priority
   - Mobile usability is critical for on-the-go staff

4. **System Reliability**:
   - Data integrity is paramount for medical records
   - Error handling must be robust
   - Consider backup and recovery strategies
