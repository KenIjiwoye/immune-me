# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The Immunization Records Management System is in the initial setup phase. The project has been scaffolded with:

1. **Backend**: AdonisJS v6 application with basic configuration
   - Basic project structure established
   - Database migrations for users table created
   - Authentication module installed but not configured
   - Routes file contains only a "hello world" endpoint

2. **Frontend**: React Native application using Expo
   - Basic project structure established
   - Default screen with placeholder content
   - No custom components or screens implemented yet

## Recent Changes

As this is the project initialization, there are no significant recent changes to note. The project is starting with:

1. **Project Requirements**: Detailed project brief created with system requirements, data models, and API endpoints
2. **Memory Bank**: Initial documentation created to establish project context and technical foundation

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

### Backend Development

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Configure PostgreSQL connection
   - Create migrations for all required tables (Patients, Facilities, Vaccines, Immunization Records, Notifications)

2. **Authentication System**:
   - Implement JWT authentication
   - Configure role-based access control

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for all entities
   - Add validation for request data
   - Implement error handling

### Frontend Development

1. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Set up authentication flow
   - Create main navigation structure

2. **Authentication Screens**:
   - Login screen
   - Password recovery

3. **Core Screens**:
   - Dashboard
   - Patient list and search
   - Patient details
   - Immunization form

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Using JWT for stateless authentication
   - Need to determine token expiration policy
   - Consider refresh token implementation

2. **Data Modeling**:
   - Relationships between entities defined in project brief
   - Need to finalize database schema details
   - Consider indexing strategy for performance

3. **API Design**:
   - RESTful API structure defined
   - Need to standardize response formats
   - Consider pagination for list endpoints

4. **UI/UX Approach**:
   - Mobile-first design for hospital staff
   - Need to establish component library
   - Consider offline capabilities for future iterations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Backend follows AdonisJS conventions with controllers, models, and services
   - Frontend will use feature-based organization

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for React components
   - camelCase for variables and functions
   - snake_case for database columns

3. **State Management**:
   - TanStack Query for server state
   - Context API for global application state

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Backend: Unit tests for services, integration tests for API endpoints
   - Frontend: Component tests and end-to-end tests

## Learnings and Project Insights

As the project is just beginning, key insights will be documented as development progresses. Initial considerations include:

1. **Healthcare Data Sensitivity**:
   - All patient data must be handled with appropriate security measures
   - Compliance with healthcare data regulations is essential

2. **User Experience for Healthcare Workers**:
   - Interface must be efficient for busy healthcare environments
   - Quick access to patient records is a priority
   - Mobile usability is critical for on-the-go staff

3. **System Reliability**:
   - Data integrity is paramount for medical records
   - Error handling must be robust
   - Consider backup and recovery strategies
