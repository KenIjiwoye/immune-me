# Active Context

## Current Focus
**FE-08: Admin Vaccine Management System** - COMPLETED with UI adjustments

## What Was Just Completed
Successfully implemented the complete admin vaccine management system as specified in FE-08 ticket, with additional UI improvements:

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Admin-Only Access**: Restricted vaccine management to users with admin role
- **Vaccine List Management**: Display all vaccines with search, filter, and pagination
- **Vaccine Creation**: Form to add new vaccines with all Liberia EPI fields
- **Vaccine Editing**: Update existing vaccine information
- **Vaccine Series Management**: Handle multi-dose vaccine series (OPV, Penta, PCV, etc.)
- **Bulk Operations**: Enabled bulk vaccine operations for efficiency
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing VaccineSelector component

### ✅ UI/UX Improvements Made
1. **Hidden Admin Link**: Admin navigation link is now hidden from regular users (only visible to administrators)
2. **Lock Icon**: Added lock-closed-outline icon for the Admin drawer item for consistent UI design
3. **Role-based Navigation**: Drawer dynamically shows/hides admin section based on user role

### ✅ Liberia EPI Specific Features
- **Standard Vaccines Support**: BCG, OPV series, Penta series, PCV series, Rota series, IPV, MCV series, YF, TCV, Vitamin A series
- **Vaccine Codes**: Support for standard Liberia EPI vaccine codes
- **Sequence Management**: Handle vaccine sequence numbers for series
- **Schedule Ages**: Configure recommended ages for each vaccine
- **Series Grouping**: Visual grouping of related vaccines in series

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Check user role before allowing access (using 'administrator' role)
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- **API Integration**: Use existing vaccine endpoints with TanStack Query
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all operations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface for tablet/phone use

## Files Created/Modified
1. **Admin Layout** (`frontend/app/(drawer)/admin/_layout.tsx`) - Admin route protection
2. **Admin Dashboard** (`frontend/app/(drawer)/admin/index.tsx`) - Admin dashboard with navigation
3. **Vaccine Management Layout** (`frontend/app/(drawer)/admin/vaccines/_layout.tsx`) - Vaccine routes
4. **Vaccine List Screen** (`frontend/app/(drawer)/admin/vaccines/index.tsx`) - Main vaccine management interface
5. **Vaccine Form Component** (`frontend/app/components/VaccineForm.tsx`) - Reusable form for add/edit
6. **Add Vaccine Screen** (`frontend/app/(drawer)/admin/vaccines/add.tsx`) - New vaccine creation
7. **Edit Vaccine Screen** (`frontend/app/(drawer)/admin/vaccines/[id].tsx`) - Existing vaccine editing
8. **Drawer Layout** (`frontend/app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx`) - Updated to hide admin link from non-admins and use lock icon

## Key Features Implemented
- **Quick Select**: Pre-configured Liberia EPI vaccines for rapid data entry
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time search and series-based filtering
- **Responsive Cards**: Mobile-optimized vaccine display cards
- **Form Validation**: Zod-based validation with clear error messages
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators throughout
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Series Management**: Visual grouping and management of vaccine series
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Admin section only visible to administrators

## Next Steps
- All frontend tickets (FE-01 through FE-08) have been completed
- System is ready for integration testing
- Consider adding bulk import/export functionality
- Prepare for user acceptance testing

## Technical Notes
- Used React Hook Form with Zod for robust form handling
- Integrated TanStack Query for efficient data management
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Created reusable components for consistency
- Followed mobile-first responsive design principles
- Dynamic drawer navigation based on user role
