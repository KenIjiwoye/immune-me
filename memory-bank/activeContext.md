# Active Context

## Current Focus
**FE-08: Admin Vaccine Management System** - COMPLETED with Vaccine Seeder

## What Was Just Completed
Successfully created a comprehensive vaccine seeder instead of fixing the form issue, as requested. The seeder includes all Liberia EPI standard vaccines.

### ✅ Vaccine Seeder Created
**Location**: `backend/database/seeders/vaccine_seeder.ts`

**Features**:
- **26 total vaccines** covering complete Liberia EPI schedule
- **Proper vaccine codes** following Liberia EPI standards
- **Correct sequence numbers** for multi-dose vaccines
- **Standard schedule ages** as per Liberia EPI guidelines
- **Supplementary vaccine marking** for Vitamin A and TT series
- **All vaccines active** by default

### ✅ Vaccines Included
1. **BCG** (1 vaccine) - Tuberculosis prevention
2. **OPV Series** (4 vaccines) - Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV-0, OPV-1, OPV-2, OPV-3)
3. **Penta Series** (3 vaccines) - Pentavalent vaccine (Penta-1, Penta-2, Penta-3)
4. **PCV Series** (3 vaccines) - Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
5. **Rota Series** (2 vaccines) - Rotavirus vaccine
6. **IPV** (1 vaccine) - Inactivated Polio Vaccine
7. **MCV Series** (2 vaccines) - Measles-containing vaccine

9. **TCV** (1 vaccine) - Typhoid conjugate vaccine
10. **Vitamin A Series** (4 vaccines) - Vitamin A supplementation
11. **Tetanus Toxoid Series** (5 vaccines) - For pregnant women

### ✅ Files Created
1. **Vaccine Seeder** (`backend/database/seeders/vaccine_seeder.ts`)
2. **Database Seeder** (`backend/database/seeders/database_seeder.ts`)
3. **Instructions** (`backend/SEED_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)

## How to Use

### Running the Seeders
```bash
cd backend
node ace db:seed                    # Run all seeders
node ace db:seed --files="database/seeders/vaccine_seeder"  # Run vaccine seeder only
```

### Verification Steps
1. **Login to app** with admin credentials
2. **Navigate to immunization recording** - vaccines will appear in selector
3. **Check admin vaccine management** - all vaccines will be listed
4. **Verify vaccine details** - codes, sequences, and ages are correct

## Technical Implementation
- **Comprehensive coverage** of Liberia EPI schedule
- **Proper data structure** matching backend vaccine model
- **Standard naming conventions** for vaccine codes
- **Supplementary marking** for non-routine vaccines
- **Ready for immediate use** after seeding

## Next Steps
1. **Run the seeders** to populate database with vaccines
2. **Test vaccine selection** in immunization recording
3. **Verify admin functionality** works with seeded data
4. **Proceed with integration testing** using real vaccine data

## Status
- ✅ Vaccine seeder created and ready
- ✅ All Liberia EPI vaccines included
- ✅ Instructions provided for running seeders
- ✅ Ready for immediate deployment and testing
