## Current Work Focus

The Immunization Records Management System is now focusing on implementing support for the Liberia immunization schedule. The project has been scaffolded with:

1. **Backend**: AdonisJS v6 application with basic configuration
   - Basic project structure established
   - Database migrations for users table created
   - Authentication module installed but not configured
   - Routes file contains only a "hello world" endpoint

2. **Frontend**: React Native application using Expo
   - Basic project structure established
   - Default screen with placeholder content
   - No custom components or screens implemented yet

3. **Task Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation structure created
   - High-level task structure overview
   - Detailed task files with code examples
   - Summary files for complex tasks to address potential truncation issues
   - README explaining the documentation approach

## Recent Changes

Recent changes to the project include:

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Liberia Immunization Schedule Implementation**:
   - Phased approach with high, medium, and low priority features
   - Data model changes as foundation for all functionality
   - UI/UX redesign to accommodate Liberia-specific requirements
   - Reporting aligned with Liberia's healthcare system needs

1. **Containerization Strategy**:
   - Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized images
   - Docker Compose for orchestrating all services
   - Environment variable management through .env files
   - Volume mounting for persistent database storage
   - Health checks for service monitoring
   - Network isolation for secure service communication

2. **Documentation Strategy**:
   - Multi-layered approach to address token limit issues
   - Prioritizing critical information at the beginning of files
   - Using summary files for complex tasks
   - Providing clear cross-references between related tasks

3. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Using JWT for stateless authentication
   - Need to determine token expiration policy
   - Consider refresh token implementation

4. **Data Modeling**:
   - Relationships between entities defined in project brief
   - PostgreSQL database configured with proper connection settings
   - Enhanced schema to support Liberia immunization schedule
   - New tables for vaccine schedules, schedule items, and supplementary immunizations
   - Consider indexing strategy for performance, especially for schedule-based queries

5. **API Design**:
   - RESTful API structure defined
   - Need to standardize response formats
   - Consider pagination for list endpoints

6. **UI/UX Approach**:
   - Mobile-first design for hospital staff
   - Need to establish component library
   - Consider offline capabilities for future iterations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Documentation Patterns**:
   - Task files follow a consistent structure: Context, Dependencies, Requirements, Code Examples
   - Summary files focus on key information: Core Functionality, Key Components, Data Flow, API Endpoints
   - Cross-references between related tasks to provide context

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Backend follows AdonisJS conventions with controllers, models, and services
   - Frontend uses feature-based organization
   - Components are designed to be reusable across screens

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for React components
   - camelCase for variables and functions
   - snake_case for database columns
   - Task files follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., BE-01-database-config.md)

4. **Frontend Development Standards**:
   - **Form Handling**: Use React Hook Form for all forms throughout the application
   - **Validation**: Use Zod schemas for form validation and API response validation
   - **Server State**: Use TanStack Query for all API calls and server state management
   - **User Feedback**: Use React Native Toast Message for success/error notifications
   - **Global State**: Use Context API for authentication and global application state

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - Backend: Unit tests for services, integration tests for API endpoints
   - Frontend: Component tests and end-to-end tests

## Frontend Development Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: The following packages have been installed and MUST be used consistently across all frontend development:

### Required Package Usage

1. **React Hook Form (^7.60.0)** - MANDATORY for ALL forms
   - Use `useForm` hook for form state management
   - Implement `Controller` component for custom inputs
   - Leverage built-in validation and error handling
   - Example: Login forms, patient registration, immunization recording

2. **Zod (^4.0.5)** - MANDATORY for ALL validation
   - Create schemas for form validation
   - Validate API responses for type safety
   - Use with React Hook Form via `@hookform/resolvers/zod`
   - Example: Patient data validation, immunization record validation

3. **TanStack Query (^5.83.0)** - MANDATORY for ALL API calls
   - Use `useQuery` for data fetching
   - Use `useMutation` for create/update/delete operations
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Leverage automatic caching and background updates
   - Example: Patient lists, immunization records, dashboard data

4. **React Native Toast Message (^2.3.3)** - MANDATORY for ALL user feedback
   - Use for success messages after successful operations
   - Use for error messages when operations fail
   - Use for informational messages to guide users
   - Configure at app root level and use throughout the application

### Implementation Standards

- **No manual form state management** - Always use React Hook Form
- **No manual validation logic** - Always use Zod schemas
- **No fetch/axios calls** - Always use TanStack Query
- **No alert() or custom modals for simple feedback** - Always use Toast Message
- **Consistent error handling** - Use TanStack Query's error handling with Toast notifications
- **Type safety** - Leverage Zod schemas for TypeScript type inference

### Code Examples

```typescript
// Form with validation
const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8)
});

const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema)
});

// API call with mutation
const loginMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (data) => api.post('/auth/login', data),
  onSuccess: () => {
    Toast.show({ type: 'success', text1: 'Login successful' });
  },
  onError: () => {
    Toast.show({ type: 'error', text1: 'Login failed' });
  }
});
```

This approach ensures consistent code quality, better user experience, and maintainable codebase across all frontend features.
